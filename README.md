The user will enter the data and click the SUBMIT button for each customer. On each submit, your 
program will check to make sure that data was entered in each field. If not, you must tell the user what 
is missing and place the cursor in that field. Once all data is entered, a new customer will be created 
and added to the customer array. Data will be stored in app.txt file If APP box is checked and data will 
be stored in music.txt file if the MUSIC box is checked. You will then clear all fields and set the focus in 
the name field. When completely finished, the user will click the FINISH button and program will 
terminate.
